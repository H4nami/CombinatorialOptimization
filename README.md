# CombinatorialOptimization
This repo contains a folder with a few scripts i wrote to solve some instances of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). 
Using Nearest neighbour (heuristic1), farthest neighbour (heuristic2), and a third heuristic that gets the value/weight ratio.

The other folder contains a script to solve the Minimum Latency Problem (MLP), this can be achieved using a centered or randomized node, aditionally you can activate a 2-OPT algorithm to get better results.

I apologize for the code and comments in spanish, i will refactor the code later.
